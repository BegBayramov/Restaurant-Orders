# Restaurant-Orders
🍽️ Restaurant Orders Analysis (SQL + Power BI) 
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes a quarter’s worth of orders from a fictitious restaurant serving international cuisine.
The dataset contains detailed information about each order, including order date and time, ordered items, item categories, cuisines, and prices.

The goal of this project is to use SQL for data analysis and transformation, and Power BI for visualization, to extract meaningful business insights that could help improve menu planning and sales strategy. 

🗂️ Dataset Description
The dataset includes:
Order date and time
Order ID
Item name
Item category
Cuisine type
Item price
The data represents one quarter of restaurant activity. 

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
PostgreSQL – data cleaning, joins, aggregations, analytical queries
Power BI – dashboards and visual analysis
GitHub – project documentation and version control  

🔍 Key Business Questions

The analysis focuses on answering the following questions:
What were the most and least ordered items, and which categories do they belong to?
What do the highest-spend orders look like?
Which items were purchased?
How much was spent per order?
Are there specific times or periods with more or fewer orders?
Based on the data, which cuisines should be expanded with more menu items? 

📊 Data Analysis (SQL)

Using SQL, the following steps were performed:
Joining order and menu tables
Aggregating total orders and revenue per item
Identifying top and bottom performing items
Analyzing order frequency by time (hour / date)
Calculating total spend per order
Grouping results by category and cuisine
The final SQL outputs were saved as clean, analysis-ready tables for visualization in Power BI. 

📈 Power BI Dashboard

The Power BI report includes:
Most & least ordered items
Revenue contribution by category and cuisine
Highest-value orders breakdown
Order volume by time (daily / hourly patterns)
These visualizations help clearly identify customer preferences and peak ordering times. 

🧠 Key Insights

Certain items and categories clearly dominate total orders
A small number of high-value orders contribute significantly to revenue
Peak ordering times suggest optimal staffing and promotion windows
Some cuisines show strong demand and are good candidates for menu expansion  

🚀 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how SQL-driven analysis combined with BI visualization can support data-driven decisions in the restaurant industry.
The insights from this analysis could help restaurant managers:
Optimize the menu
Focus on high-performing cuisines
Improve operational planning during peak hours
